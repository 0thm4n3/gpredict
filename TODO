Future plans for gpredict development include:

* Add new satellites to database when updating TLE.
* Print predicted satellite passes.
* Choose between civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight when predicting
  satellite visibilities.
* Show day/night on satmap.
* Optionally, use simulated time as T0 for predictions.
* TLE editor.
* Automated radio and antenna rotator.
* Advanced pass predictor.
* Predict communication windows between two ground stations.
* Determine all orbit types.
* Add option to show Ra in HMS instead of degrees.
* Scheduler / External Hooks (menubar, see 1313635, 724998)
* Save future pass prediction reports as HTML.
* Print future pass predictions.
* Possibility to show geographical coordinates for ground station on map
  and polar views.
* Online help.
* Native Mac OS X port.
* Dynamic reconfiguration. No need to re-load modules if configuration changes
* Plot more parameters in detailed pass prediction dialogue (depending
  on settingss).
* Predict satellite parameters over a given time period (Tools).
* Solar illumination prediction.
* Treat Sun and Moon as satellites.
* Improve time controller to have tuning-like behaviour, i.e. when
   minutes flip from 59 to 0 the hour is incremented.
* Toggle the ground track on and off for all the satellites on the map.
