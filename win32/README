### Win32 build notes ###

# Phil Ashby, Dec 2017

Check config.mk for dependant packages. I recommend use of inline sed
to fix up pkg-config file prefix settings once unpacked, then fix up and
copy in gtk+-3.0.pc and gdk.pc if required.

Compile tested on Debian 9 (stretch) using standard mingw-w64 toolchain.

Sorry, no installer package as yet, you will need to copy out all the
binary DLLs from dependant packages along with gpredict.exe to your
target system. Then create <target>/share/gpredict and recursively copy
in these folders: ../data ../pixmaps

Configured to build the console version, as this usefully logs errors
to stdout, see -mconsole option in Makefile for building GUI only exe.

Good luck!
Phlash.
