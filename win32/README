### Win32 build notes ###

# Phil Ashby, Dec 2017

Check config.mk for dependant packages. I recommend use of inline sed
to fix up pkg-config file prefix settings once unpacked, then fix up and
copy in gtk+-3.0.pc and gdk.pc if required.

Compile tested on Debian 9 (stretch) using standard mingw-w64 toolchain.

To build a deployable ZIP archive, use 'make dist', which packages all
binary DLLs from dependant packages along with gpredict[-con].exe into
a versioned ZIP.

Good luck!
Phlash.
